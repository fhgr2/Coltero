## Setup
install atlassian-sdk and follow setup instructions from https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project/

## Build Plugin
run `atlas-mvn package`

## Run Plugin
run `atlas-run`

## Debug Plugin
run `atlas-debug`
and connect your IDE-Debugger to the debugging port 
https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/creating-a-remote-debug-target/



Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
